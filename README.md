## Summary

At the end of this course you should have learned all about how to leverage small callback functions and compose them together to create complex application rules, how to implement these functional patterns in each tier of the application, leveraging declarative coding. Some common footguns or pitfalls and how to communicate to the user, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
